Question

--Count the unique activity types for each user, ensuring users with no activities are also included.

--The output should show each user's ID and their activity type count, with zero for users who have no activities.


Solution
--left join to include all users
--count unique activity types as per question
--groupby user_id to get count per user
--order by using user_id



select u.user_id,
        count(distinct a.activity_type) as unique_activity_count
from user_profiles u
left join activity_log a on u.user_id = a.user_id
group by u.user_id
order by u.user_id
