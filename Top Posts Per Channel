--Identify the top 3 posts with the highest like counts for each channel. 
--Assign a rank to each post based on its like count, allowing for gaps in ranking when posts have the same number of likes. 
--For example, if two posts tie for 1st place, the next post should be ranked 3rd, not 2nd. Exclude any posts with zero likes.
--The output should display the channel name, post ID, post creation date, and the like count for each post.


--merge two data frames on channel_id
--count no of likes using groupby keyword using channel_name ,post_id , created_at
--assign rank to cols based on number of likes
--apply conditon for top three posts per channel
