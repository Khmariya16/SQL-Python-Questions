You have access to Facebookâ€™s database, which contains tables related to user interactions. Your task is to calculate the total number of likes from friends for each date that falls on a Friday.

A like should only be counted if the user who liked the post is a friend of the user who made the post.

The output should contain two different columns: 'date' and 'likes'.


--we want date_liked (ie friday) and count of likes on friday
-- join 1 - user id and likes tables on post_id
-- join 2 - frinedships with both tables on user_name
--extract DOW = 5 (friday)
-- group by date_liked




select 
    l.date_liked,
    count(*) as likes
from likes l
join user_posts p on p.post_id = l.post_id
join friendships f
    ON (l.user_name = f.user_name1 AND p.user_name = f.user_name2) 
    OR (l.user_name = f.user_name2 AND p.user_name = f.user_name1)
where extract(dow from l.date_liked) = 5
group by l.date_liked
order by l.date_liked
